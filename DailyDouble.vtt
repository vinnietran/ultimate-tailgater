Hello fellow tailgaters!

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.500
This is Coach Dick Lebeau, the old Pittsburgh Steeler Defensive coordinator

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Well, I'm retired now, but I miss walking the sidelines in Pittsburgh with you guys on my back

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So with that bit of an introduction

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.000
I will be honored to read to you today's Daily Double Question, and it is: 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:37.000
This Hall of Fame coach is known for his innovative Zone Blitz scheme 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Go Steelers, Go tailgaters, thank you so much for your support
